                pollinators
                and
                wildlife</i></p>
        <p class="info">
            Enthusiasm has grown recently over utilizing native plants and shrubs in home gardening. If selected and
            placed properly, native plants
            generally suffer from less insect damage and disease than non-native, or "ornamental" plants, are minimally
            invasive, and
            "create the best environments for local pollinators and wildlife."
            <br>
            <br>
            Because they are adapted to the local environment, native plants also tend to need less supplemental
            nutrition, water, and maintenance
            than ornamental plants, making them perfect for the "lazy" gardener. Although often not considered as
            pretty as the more exotic imports, a look at the
            beauties below may change your mind!<sup>11</sup><br>
