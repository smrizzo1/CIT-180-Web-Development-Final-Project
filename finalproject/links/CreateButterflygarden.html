					<summary>Butterfly Bush</summary>
		<p>A butterfly bush is a shrub that's typically covered in 
		butterflies all summer long. It is an easy-care shrub that features fragrant flowers in 
		shades of blue, purple, and white. </p>
		<p>If your butterfly bush starts to get big, prune it back in winter or early spring.
		You can cut it almost all the way down to the ground.</p>

					<summary>Salvia</summary>
		<p>There's a salvia for every garden: some are tall, others are short. Some have blue 
		or purple blooms, and others have red, orange, or pink flowers.</p>
		<p>While you might have trouble picking a salvia, the butterflies won't -- they'll reliably 
		flock to it every summer.</p>

					<summary>Phlox</summary>
		<p>Phlox bears beautiful clusters of red, pink, lavender, salmon, or white 
		blooms throughout the summer. Their lovely scent delights our noses as much 
		as their nectar delights hungry butterflies.</p>
		<p>Phlox can be troubled by a disease called powdery mildew. Look for 
		disease-resistant varieties.</p>

				<strong>Size:</strong> Up to 4 feet tall and 1 foot wide<br>

					<summary>Aster</summary>
		<p>A top plant for the fall garden, aster is a heavy bloomer with colorful 
		flowers in shades of blue, purple, pink, red, and white. </p>
		<p>Aster does double duty: The blossoms supply nectar for fall butterflies, and 
		Pearl Crescent caterpillars feed on the plant's leaves.</p>
		<p>Look for newer named varieties of asters; they're often more disease 
		resistant and compact.</p>
					<aside>
