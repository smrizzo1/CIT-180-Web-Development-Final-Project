                        "Monarch butterflies (<i>Danaus plexippus</i>) are perhaps the most well-known and beloved
                        butterflies in North America. A ubiquitous sight in gardens, prairies, and natural areas from
                        coast to coast,
                        their arrival in northern states and Canadian provinces is viewed by many as a welcome sign of
                        the change in seasons from spring to summer..."<sup>1</sup>
                    </p>
                    The bold orange-and-black pattern of this butterfly catches the eye as it flits from flower to
                    flower in open fields and gardens during the warm summer days. Native plant feeding sources for the
                    adult Monarch include bee balm (<i>Monarda fistulosa</i>), goldenrod (<i>Solidago sp.</i>), dogbane
                    (<i>Apocynum sp.</i>), and many more.<sup>2</sup>
                    <p>
                        Monarch caterpillars feed on only a few host plants in the milkweed family. Milkweed is
                        considered a nuisance plant by many people, leading to habitat destruction and
                        population decline. Sadly, adult monarch numbers have plummeted drastically over the past two
                        decades. Their "dangerously low" population levels since 2008
                        have led scientists to predict that, without human intervention, there is an 80% probability of
                        "population collapse" of the eastern monarch, and a 96-100% chance for that of
                        the western monarch, within the next 50 years.<sup>3</sup>

                    <summary><strong>Eastern Black Swallowtail</strong></summary>
                    <p>

                        The Eastern Black Swallowtail (<i>Papilio polyxenes asterius</i>) is common and much-studied
                        species, ranging "southern Canada, most of the eastern and
                        mid-western United States west to the Rocky Mountains, and southwest into Arizona and northern
                        Mexico."<sup>4</sup>
                    </p>
                    The adult black swallowtail sports two rows of yellow spots that contrast with the black of the
                    upper wings, with a patch of iridenscent blue between the rows
                    (the blue patch being more prominent in females). The underside of the wings also have "rows of
                    bright orange spots separated by areas of powdery blue."<sup>4</sup>
                    Eastern black swallowtails are ususally found in "open areas, including both uplands and wet area â€”
                    wet prairies, fields, flat-woods, pine savannas, roadsides,
                    weedy areas, and gardens (Minno et al 2005)."<sup>4</sup>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        The females lay their eggs on host plants in the carrot family, including both native species
                        (such as mock bishopweed (<i>Ptilimnium capillaceum</i>)
                        and wedgeleaf eryngo (<i>Eryngium cuneifolium</i>) and introduced species (like poison hemlock
                        (<i>Conium maculatum L.</i>) and
                        Queen Anne's lace (<i>Daucus carota L.</i>)). In gardens, the caterpillars may also be found on
                        human favorites in the same family such as dill (<i>Anethum graveolens L</i>) and
                        sweet fennel (<i>Foeniculum vulgare Mill.</i>). This can lead to the species being considered a
                        "nuisance" pest by some.<sup>4</sup>

                    <p>

                        The Karner blue (<i>Lycaeides melissa samuelis</i>) is another butterfly you may see in
                        Michigan. Unfortunately,
                        this species is on the endangered list and threatened with extinction, as the only host plant
                        for its caterpillars is the
                        Wild Lupine (<i>Lupis perennis</i>), which itself increasingly rare due to loss of habitat.
                        <sup>5</sup>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This butterfly is much smaller than the Monarch or the
                        Swallowtail, with a wingspan of only
                        about one inch. The males and females differ in appearance, with the males sporting
                        silvery or dark blue top wings while the females are grayish brown. Both have gray undersides
                        and
                        with "irregular
                        bands of orange crescents" inside a narrow black margin.<sup>5</sup> </p>

                    <p>
                        It's host, Wild Lupine, "is a plant that thrives in areas that are periodically disturbed, which
                        reduces or
                        eliminates overhead canopies and plant competition.
                        Historically, fire provided open barrens and savanna habitats for colonization by lupine and
                        Karner blues. Not surprisingly,
                        fire suppression has consistently been identified as the primary factor affecting the
                        butterfly's population decline and reduction in range." <sup>6</sup>
                        <br>
                        Michigan gardeners can help this little treasure by sowing lupine seeds in "dry, sandy soils in
                        open to partially shaded habitats" in their yards.

            <p>Planting native food sources for these butterfly adults and caterpillars not only beautify our gardens,
                byways, and open places, it will help our flittering friends in their fight against climate change
                and habitat destruction. By helping butterflies ensure their continued existence, it will help us ensure
                sightings of these little "flashes of joy" for our children and grandchildren in the future.
