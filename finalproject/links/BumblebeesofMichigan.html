        <p>Does the sight of the first bumblebee of spring buzzing from flower to flower bring a smile to your face? It may even bring a song to
            mind. Some may think of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's composition, "Flight of the Bumblebee": <br><br>

            <p>Or perhaps a classic from the Bee-Gees is more your style?:</p>

        <p>Maybe instead of a song, our fuzzy friends remind you of scenes from a movie:</p>

         </ul>

        <p>In reality, however, you are much more likely to hear something similar to the clip below during your meadow walks than melodious Aussies or
            frantic violins:</p>

            While they are delightful to stop and watch, we should also remember that their admirably industrious pollen-collecting doesn't only benefit themselves - they are busy feeding humans, as well. Per the Xerxes Society, bumblebees are 
            "excellent pollinators of many crops. Bumble bees are able to fly in cooler temperatures and lower 
           light levels than many other bees, and they perform a behavior called “buzz pollination,” in which the bee grabs the pollen 
           producing structure of the flower in her jaws and vibrates her wing musculature causing vibrations that dislodge pollen that 
           would have otherwise remained trapped in the flower’s anthers. Some plants, including tomatoes, peppers, and cranberries, 
           require buzz pollination,"<sup>4</sup> as explained in this video:</p>

        <p>Below are some of the bumblebee species you may see in Michigan. Unfortunately, some species have become more rare than others. 
            In 2016, for example, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service placed Bombus <i>terricola</i> (the Yellow Banded bumblebee) on their 7-year National Listing workplan.
            In 2017, Bombus <i>affinis</i> (the Rusty Patched bumblebee) was placed on the Endangered Species list. 
            Both species are listed as Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) in the Michigan Wildlife Action Plan.<sup>1</sup>

            require buzz pollination."<sup>4</sup>
        <p>
            "All bumble bees belong to the genus Bombus within the family Apidae. The family Apidae includes the well-known honey bees and 
            bumble bees, as well as carpenter bees, cuckoo bees, digger bees, stingless bees, and orchid bees...Bumble bees are important pollinators of wild flowering plants and crops. As 
            generalist foragers, they do not depend on any one flower type. However, some plants do rely on bumble bees to achieve 
            pollination. Loss of bumble bees can have far ranging ecological impacts due to their role as pollinators. In Britain and 
            the Netherlands, where multiple bumble bee and other bee species have gone extinct, there is evidence of decline in the 
            abundances of insect pollinated plants."<sup>4</sup>

                <h2>Michigan Special Concern species: Bombus <i>borealis</i> (Northern Amber)</h2>
                    <p>"The northern amber, like other bumble bees, live in colonies composed of a single queen and female workers. Colonies start 
                    to produce new queens and males in the mid- to late summer. Only new, mated queens overwinter, emerging from diapause 
                    (a form of hibernation) in the spring. New queens are responsible for finding a new nest site, laying eggs, and for all of 
                    the foraging and care of the colony until the first workers emerge (Hatfield et al. 2015). Once the first workers emerge, the 
                    queen remains in the colony laying eggs. Bumble bees need areas that provide nectar and pollen from flowers 
                    throughout the duration of the colony life cycle, and suitable sites for nesting and for overwintering queens."<sup>3</sup>

                <p>"Until recently, the Yellow-banded Bumble Bee was commonly found east of the Rockies in the northern United States and into 
                    southern Canada, from eastern Montana and Alberta, across the northern states and southern portion 
                    of the Canadian provinces through to the east coast, with a southern extension along the Appalachian mountains in the 
                    eastern U.S."<sup>4</sup> </p>
                <p>"The Yellow-banded Bumble Bee has not been seen in most parts of its range in the U.S. since 1999, with the exception of records 
                    in a few locations in Wisconsin in 2007 and a single location in Pennsylvania in 2006. 
                    This bee has not been seen in many years in Tennessee, New York, Maine and Vermont, although it commonly occurred in these 
                    states in the past."<sup>4</sup></p>

                    through September."<sup>6</sup></p>
                <p>"Historically, the rusty patched bumble bee was broadly distributed across the eastern United States and Upper Midwest, from 
                    Maine in the U.S. and southern Quebec and Ontario in Canada, south to the northeast corner of Georgia, reaching west to the 
                    eastern edges of North and South Dakota...Since 2000, this bumble bee has been reported from only 13 states and 1 Canadian 
                    province..."<sup>6</sup>
